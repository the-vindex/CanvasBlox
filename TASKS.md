## Chapter 11: Drawing Tools Implementation

**Status:** 🔄 In Progress (Interaction model refactor needed)
**Files:** `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`, `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx`, `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts`, `client/src/hooks/useSelectionState.ts`, `client/src/components/level-editor/Toolbar.tsx`
**Priority:** High

### Completed Tasks:
✅ **11.0** Pen tool and Drawing Mode Tools interaction pattern - Foundation for drawing tools UX
✅ **11.3** Selection tool - Click to select objects, shows properties
✅ **11.4** Move tool - Drag selected objects with ghost preview
✅ **11.8** Clear brush on tool change - Mutual exclusion between tools/tiles
✅ **11.X** Multi-select tool - Drag box selection (bonus feature)
✅ **11.11** Fix ESC key not cancelling palette tool - Critical bug fixed

---

### 🎨 Drawing Mode Tools Concept

**Industry Pattern** (Photoshop, GIMP, Tiled):
- **Tool first, material second** - Select drawing tool, then choose what to draw with
- Switching materials (tiles) keeps the tool active
- Drawing tools are visually grouped and work together

**Our Drawing Mode Tools:**
```
┌─── Drawing Mode Tools ──────┐  ┌─── Other Tools ─────┐
│ [Pen] [Line] [Rectangle]    │  │ [Select] [Move] ... │
└─────────────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘
     ↕ Enable/disable based on tile selection
```

**State Transition Rules:**
```
User Action                    → selectedTool    | selectedTileType
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Select tile (no tool active)   → 'pen'           | 'platform-basic'
Select tile (line tool active) → 'line'          | 'platform-basic'  ✅ keeps tool
Select line tool (tile active) → 'line'          | (preserved)        ✅
Select different tile          → 'pen'/'line'    | 'platform-grass'   ✅ keeps tool
Select non-drawing tool        → 'select'        | null               ❌ clears tile
Press ESC                      → null            | null               ❌ clears both
```

**Key Behaviors:**
- Drawing mode tools (`pen`, `line`, `rectangle`) work ONLY when tile selected
- Switching between drawing mode tools preserves tile selection
- Switching tiles preserves active drawing mode tool
- Non-drawing tools (`select`, `move`, `multiselect`, `link`) are mutually exclusive with tiles
- ESC clears both tool and tile

---

### Remaining Tasks:

#### 11.0 Implement Pen tool and refactor interaction model ✅ Complete
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Commit 4a3ea24 - User tested and approved
- **Location:** `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`, `client/src/hooks/useSelectionState.ts`, `client/src/components/level-editor/Toolbar.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Create explicit "pen" tool and implement Drawing Mode Tools interaction pattern
- **What was implemented:**
  1. ✅ **Added 'pen' tool to EditorState** (`client/src/types/level.ts`)
     - Updated `selectedTool` type to include `'pen'`
     - Auto-selects pen when tile selected
  2. ✅ **Extracted pen tool logic** (`client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`)
     - Changed implicit painting → explicit `selectedTool === 'pen'` mode
     - Matches line tool implementation pattern
  3. ✅ **Refactored state transitions** (`client/src/hooks/useSelectionState.ts`)
     - Defined `DRAWING_TOOLS = ['pen', 'line', 'rectangle']`
     - Auto-selects pen when tile selected (no drawing tool active)
     - Preserves active drawing tool when selecting tiles
     - Preserves tile when switching between drawing tools
     - Clears tile when switching to non-drawing tools
  4. ✅ **Visual grouping in toolbar** (`client/src/components/level-editor/Toolbar.tsx`)
     - Grouped pen/line/rectangle tools in dedicated section
     - Green color theme for drawing tools (vs blue for selection tools)
     - Added pen icon SVG matching existing icon style
  5. ✅ **Updated keyboard shortcuts** (`client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx`)
     - Added 'B' key for pen tool (Brush)
     - ESC clears both tool and tile
- **Tests:**
  - ✅ 18 unit tests passing (useSelectionState)
  - ✅ 4 E2E tests for Drawing Mode Tools pattern
  - ✅ All existing tests updated to reflect new behavior
- **Manual Test:**
  - Select a tile from palette → verify pen tool auto-selects (toolbar shows green)
  - With pen active, press 'L' → verify line tool selected and tile remains selected
  - With line tool active, select different tile → verify line tool stays active
  - Press 'V' (select tool) → verify tile deselects
  - Press ESC → verify both tool and tile clear
  - Press 'B' → verify pen tool selects
- **Note:** Foundation for entire drawing tools UX - 11.1 (line) and 11.2 (rectangle) now properly integrated

#### 11.1 Implement line drawing tool ⚠️ Algorithm Complete, Needs Interaction Model Integration
- **Status:** Partially complete - Algorithm done, needs Task 11.0 refactor
- **Commit:** 2f0247e (algorithm implementation)
- **What's Working:**
  - ✅ Bresenham's line algorithm (`lineDrawing.ts`)
  - ✅ Line preview rendering (`drawPreviewLine()` in canvasRenderer)
  - ✅ Mouse handlers for line drawing
  - ✅ Real-time preview while dragging
  - ✅ Batch tile placement with single undo/redo
  - ✅ ESC cancellation during drag
  - ✅ Tests: 4 E2E + 10 unit (all passing)
- **What Needs Refactoring** (blocked by Task 11.0):
  - ⚠️ Interaction model - currently uses old mutual exclusion logic
  - ⚠️ Should be part of drawing mode tools group
  - ⚠️ Should preserve tile when switching to/from line tool
  - ⚠️ Current `useSelectionState` logic needs updating
- **After Task 11.0 Complete:**
  - Update tests to reflect new interaction model
  - Verify line tool works in drawing mode tools group
  - Mark as complete after manual testing

#### 11.2 Implement rectangle drawing tool ⏸️ Not Started
- **Location:** `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - mouse event handlers
- **Current:** Rectangle tool button exists in toolbar ('r' key) but does nothing when activated
- **Dependencies:** Requires Task 11.0 (drawing mode tools interaction model) to be complete first
- **Implementation:**
  - Similar to line tool (Task 11.1), but draw rectangle instead of line
  - On mousedown: Record start corner position
  - On mousemove: Show preview rectangle from start to current position
  - On mouseup: Place tiles to form rectangle (outline or filled)
  - Works as part of drawing mode tools group (preserves tile selection)
- **Rectangle Fill Options:**
  - **Default:** Outline only (consistent with line tool)
  - **Optional:** Shift key to toggle filled mode
  - **Future:** Add toggle button to toolbar for persistent fill preference
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` (add rectangle drawing logic)
  - `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts` (add drawPreviewRectangle method)
  - `client/src/utils/rectangleDrawing.ts` (new file - rectangle calculation utility)
- **Tests to add:**
  - E2E: Draw outline rectangle
  - E2E: Draw filled rectangle (if implemented)
  - E2E: Rectangle with different tile types
  - Unit: Rectangle position calculation
- **Note:** Part of drawing mode tools group - must follow same interaction patterns as pen and line tools

#### 11.5 Implement linking tool for interactable objects
- **Location:** `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - mouse event handlers
- **Current:** Link tool button exists in toolbar ('k' key) but does nothing when activated
- **Purpose:** Link interactable objects (buttons → doors, levers → doors, etc.) to create cause-effect relationships
- **Implementation:**
  - Click first object (source): Mark as link source, highlight visually
  - Click second object (target): Create link from source to target
  - Store link in source object's `properties.linkedObjects` array
  - Store reverse link in target object's `properties.linkedFrom` array (for bidirectional tracking)
  - Draw visual connection line between linked objects (already exists in canvasRenderer.ts:829-855)
  - Exit link mode or allow chaining multiple links
- **Validation needed:**
  - Only interactable objects can be linked (not tiles or spawn points)
  - Prevent linking object to itself
  - Prevent duplicate links
  - Visual feedback for valid/invalid link targets
- **UI considerations:**
  - Show which object is currently the link source (highlight or indicator)
  - Escape or right-click to cancel linking
  - Visual preview line while selecting target
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` (add link mode logic)
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` (add linkObjects function)
  - `client/src/types/level.ts` (ObjectProperties already has linkedObjects/linkedFrom)
- **Note:** Tool button already exists, visual line rendering exists, just needs interaction logic

#### 11.6 Implement unlinking tool for removing object links
- **Location:** `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts`, `client/src/components/level-editor/PropertiesPanel.tsx`
- **Current:** No UI or functionality exists to remove links between objects
- **Purpose:** Allow users to remove unwanted links between interactable objects
- **Implementation options:**
  1. **Properties Panel approach:** Show list of linked objects in properties panel, add "X" button to remove each link
  2. **Selection-based:** Select linked object → keyboard shortcut (e.g., 'U' for unlink) → click link to remove
  3. **Context menu:** Right-click on object → "Manage Links" → show dialog with checkboxes for each link
- **Recommended approach:** Properties Panel (option 1) - most discoverable
- **Implementation:**
  - In PropertiesPanel, display `properties.linkedObjects` array as clickable list
  - Add delete/remove button next to each linked object ID
  - On click: Remove object ID from `properties.linkedObjects` array
  - Also remove reverse link from target object's `properties.linkedFrom` array
  - Update level state and trigger re-render
  - Add to undo/redo history
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/components/level-editor/PropertiesPanel.tsx` (add links UI section)
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` (add unlinkObjects function)
- **Note:** Currently there's no way to remove links once created - important for fixing mistakes

#### 11.7 Decide on rotation tool approach or remove it
- **Location:** `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx` - Rotate left/right buttons in toolbar
- **Current:** Rotate left/right buttons exist in header but unclear how rotation should work
- **Decision needed:**
  1. **Keep rotation - apply to selected objects:** When object(s) selected, rotate buttons rotate them (90° increments)
  2. **Keep rotation - apply to tile being placed:** When placing tile, rotate buttons rotate preview before placement
  3. **Remove rotation:** If rotation doesn't make sense for gameplay, remove buttons entirely
- **Considerations:**
  - Tiles have `rotation` property (0, 90, 180, 270) in level.ts:12
  - Objects have `rotation` property in level.ts:40
  - Rotation rendering already implemented in canvasRenderer.ts (tiles: 206-212, objects: 570-582)
  - Current rotate left/right handlers exist in LevelEditor.tsx
- **If keeping rotation:**
  - Make buttons context-aware (only enabled when object selected or tile type selected)
  - Add visual feedback showing rotation angle
  - Consider keyboard shortcuts ([ and ] keys for rotate left/right)
  - Update PropertiesPanel to show/edit rotation value
- **If removing rotation:**
  - Remove rotate buttons from toolbar
  - Remove handleRotateLeft/handleRotateRight from LevelEditor.tsx
  - Remove rotation keyboard handlers (if any)
  - Keep rotation property in data model for future use
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx` (rotate button handlers)
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` (add rotateObjects function if keeping)
  - `client/src/components/level-editor/PropertiesPanel.tsx` (rotation UI if keeping)
- **Note:** User requested decision on rotation tool - needs clarification on intended use case

#### 11.9 Implement button numbering system (coordinate with linking tool)
- **Location:** `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts` - drawObject method (button rendering), `client/src/types/level.ts`
- **Current:** Buttons are drawn with generic appearance, no visual identification system
- **Purpose:** Add visual numbering to buttons on canvas so users can identify which button links to which door
- **Implementation:**
  - Add optional `buttonNumber` or `label` property to InteractableObject type
  - Auto-assign numbers when buttons are created (e.g., Button 1, Button 2, etc.)
  - Render number/label on button visual in canvasRenderer.ts drawButton method
  - Display as white text or small badge on the button graphic
- **Integration with linking:**
  - When linking button to door, could optionally label door with same number
  - Show button number in Properties Panel when selected
  - Show linked button numbers on linked doors
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/types/level.ts` (add label/number property to InteractableObject)
  - `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts` (drawButton method - add text rendering)
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` (addObject - auto-assign button numbers)
  - `client/src/components/level-editor/PropertiesPanel.tsx` (display button number/label)
- **Note:** Should be implemented together with Task 11.5 (linking tool) for coherent UX

#### 11.10 Implement tile overlap logic - newest tile wins
- **Location:** `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` - addTile function, `client/src/utils/levelSerializer.ts` - deserialize/import functions
- **Current:** Tiles can be placed on top of each other without removing old tiles, creating overlapping tiles at same position
- **Change:** When a new tile is placed at a position where another tile exists, remove the old tile(s) at that position
- **Exception:** Button placed on top of door should NOT delete the door (special case for puzzle mechanics)
- **Implementation:**
  - In `addTile` function: Before adding new tile, check for existing tiles at same position
  - Remove existing tiles at that position (filter out tiles with matching x,y coordinates)
  - Exception: If new tile is 'button' type and existing tile is 'door' type, keep both
  - Apply same logic when importing JSON levels (`deserialize` function)
  - Apply same logic when loading from localStorage (on initial load)
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` (addTile function - add overlap detection and removal)
  - `client/src/utils/levelSerializer.ts` (deserialize - clean up overlapping tiles on import)
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` (useEffect for localStorage load - clean up overlaps)
- **Note:** This prevents unintended tile stacking and keeps the level clean. Button-on-door exception supports puzzle design patterns.

#### 11.12 Enhance zoom reset to fit all content
- **Location:** Zoom reset function in `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` or zoom control handlers
- **Current:** Reset zoom sets to 100% regardless of content
- **Change:** Calculate zoom level that fits all placed content on screen (fit-to-view)
- **Implementation:**
  - Calculate bounding box of all placed objects (tiles, interactables, spawn points)
  - Determine zoom level that fits entire bounding box within viewport
  - Account for padding/margins (e.g., 10% margin around content)
  - If no objects placed, reset to 100% (current behavior)
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` or zoom control handlers
  - `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts` (if zoom calculation logic exists there)
- **Tests:**
  - E2E test: Place objects → zoom reset → verify all objects visible
  - Unit test: Verify zoom calculation for various object layouts
- **Note:** Makes zoom reset more intelligent and useful for level design workflow

**Dependencies:** None - core selection/move tools already complete
**Notes:** 8 tasks remaining. Priority: Tile overlap (11.10), Link/Unlink tools (11.5-11.6), Drawing tools (11.1-11.2), Button numbering (11.9), Rotation decision (11.7), Zoom fit-to-view (11.12)

## Chapter 13: E2E Test Simplification & Refactoring

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Files:** 13 E2E test files (3,306 lines total, 156 tests after Chapter 14 split)
**Priority:** Medium

**Final Results:**
- ✅ Phase 1 & 2 complete: Eliminated 9 redundant tests (-277 lines)
- ✅ Task 13.10 complete: Created helper utilities (`e2e/helpers.ts`)
- ✅ Task 13.11 complete: Refactored 171 patterns across 7 files using helper functions (-250 to -300 lines)
- ⏸️ Phase 4 skipped: Missing test coverage deferred to future chapters as needed

**Goals Achieved:**
- ✅ Reduce test count: -9 tests completed (exceeded original -12 goal)
- ✅ Eliminate redundant code: ~527 lines removed total (-277 from Phase 1&2, -250 from Phase 3)
- ✅ Improve test maintainability: Helper functions created and refactored across 7 files
- ⏸️ Additional coverage: Deferred to future chapters

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETE

#### 13.1 Delete redundant zoom status bar test ✅
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts:757-787` (deleted)
- **Test Name:** "Step 9: zoom controls should update status bar zoom display"
- **Result:** -1 test, -30 lines

#### 13.2 Merge Step 6 and Step 9 zoom tests ✅
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** Lines 348-406 (Step 6 - deleted), Lines 658-721 (Step 9 - kept)
- **Deleted tests:**
  - "Step 6: should increase zoom when zoom in button clicked"
  - "Step 6: should decrease zoom when zoom out button clicked"
  - "Step 6: should reset zoom when reset button clicked"
- **Kept tests (more comprehensive):**
  - "Step 9: should zoom in at viewport center when zoom in button clicked"
  - "Step 9: should zoom out at viewport center when zoom out button clicked"
  - "Step 9: should reset zoom to 100% when reset button clicked"
- **Result:** -3 tests, -62 lines

**Phase 1 Total:** -4 tests, -92 lines, improved pass rate from 88.1% to 90.2%

### Phase 2: Consolidate Interaction Tests (Medium Priority) ✅ COMPLETE

#### 13.3 Merge undo keyboard and button tests ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** Line 1333 (consolidated test - now passing)
- **What was done:**
  - Consolidated two separate undo tests into one test that checks both Ctrl+Z and button
  - Deleted old "should undo by clicking undo button" test
  - Fixed root cause: History initialization bug
- **Root cause discovered:**
  - History was starting empty (`historyIndex = -1`)
  - First action created `history[0]`, set `historyIndex = 0`
  - Undo logic required `historyIndex > 0` to work, but with only one entry, this was FALSE
  - **Fix:** Initialize history with initial state on load (`history[0] = initial state`, `historyIndex = 0`)
  - Now first action creates `history[1]`, sets `historyIndex = 1`, and undo works (goes back to `history[0]`)
- **Changes made:**
  - Added initial history entry in `useLevelEditor.ts` when level first loads
  - Updated undo button test to expect disabled state initially
  - Test now passes without `.skip`
- **Files modified:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` - Added history initialization
  - `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts` - Consolidated test (line 1333), updated disabled button test (line 1518)
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.test.ts` - Updated unit test expectations
- **Impact:** -1 test, consolidated test passing, undo/redo now works correctly

#### 13.4 Merge redo keyboard shortcuts and button tests ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** Line 1375 (consolidated test)
- **What was done:**
  - Consolidated 3 separate redo tests into 1 comprehensive test
  - Tests all redo methods: Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z, and button click
  - Simplified structure: place once, undo once, test all methods with resets
  - Added comment explaining all methods call same redo function
- **Files modified:**
  - `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts` - Consolidated test at line 1375
- **Impact:** -2 tests, -60 lines (better than expected -90 due to refactoring)

**Phase 2 Progress (7/7 complete):** -5 tests, -185 lines

#### 13.5 Merge copy keyboard and button tests ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** Lines 1613-1650 (consolidated test)
- **What was done:**
  - Consolidated two separate copy tests into one test that checks both Ctrl+C and button
  - Deleted old "should copy button click work" test
  - New test verifies both input methods produce same outcome (toast notification)
  - Follows pattern from redo consolidation (commit 6d9a118)
- **Files modified:**
  - `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts` - Consolidated test at line 1613
- **Impact:** -1 test, -25 lines
- **Commit:** 38864db

#### 13.6 Merge paste keyboard and button tests ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** Lines 1652 (consolidated test)
- **What was done:**
  - Consolidated 3 separate paste tests into one test that checks both Ctrl+V and paste button
  - Deleted redundant tests: "should paste button click work", "pasted objects should be offset from originals"
  - New test verifies both input methods produce same outcome (count increases + toast notification)
  - Follows pattern from redo/copy consolidation
  - Added comment explaining paste operation verification vs offset testing (separate concern)
- **Files modified:**
  - `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts` - Consolidated test at line 1652
- **Impact:** -2 tests, -69 lines
- **Commit:** ec4adb9

#### 13.7 Fix or remove redundant offset tests ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** Lines 1652, 1786 (and potentially line 1806)
- **Resolution:** Redundant offset tests were already removed during consolidation in tasks 13.5 and 13.6
- **Current state:** Only remaining "offset" reference is a clarifying comment at line 1668 explaining offset is tested separately
- **Files checked:** `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts`
- **Impact:** Task already complete from previous consolidation work

#### 13.8 Evaluate and refactor multi-select copy test ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** Line 1717 - "should copy multiple selected objects"
- **Resolution:** Test already skipped (`.skip`) because copy/paste functionality is being reworked in Chapter 15
- **Decision:** Leave test skipped until paste rework is complete
- **Files checked:** `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts`
- **Impact:** No action needed - will be addressed during Chapter 15 paste rework

#### 13.9 Document E2E consolidation pattern ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Location:** `docs/E2E_TESTING.md`
- **What was done:**
  - Added "Test Consolidation Pattern" section to E2E_TESTING.md
  - Documented pattern for testing keyboard shortcuts + UI buttons together
  - Included benefits, examples, and real test code showing the pattern
  - Skipped paste-related tests (paste functionality being reworked per user request)
- **Files modified:**
  - `docs/E2E_TESTING.md` - Added consolidation pattern section
  - `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts` - Skipped 3 paste tests (will be reworked)
- **Impact:** Improved documentation, clearer testing patterns for future development
- **Commit:** 739ec9b

### Phase 3: Extract Helper Functions (Low Priority)

#### 13.10 Create E2E test helper utilities file ✅ Complete
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Commit 1540d84
- **Location:** `e2e/helpers.ts` (created)
- **Purpose:** Reduce repetitive boilerplate code across all 126 tests
- **Implementation:**
  ```typescript
  // e2e/helpers.ts
  import type { Page } from '@playwright/test';

  /**
   * Click on canvas at specific coordinates relative to canvas origin
   */
  export async function clickCanvas(page: Page, x: number, y: number) {
      const canvas = page.getByTestId('level-canvas');
      const box = await canvas.boundingBox();
      if (!box) throw new Error('Canvas not found');
      await page.mouse.click(box.x + x, box.y + y);
  }

  /**
   * Place a tile at specific canvas coordinates
   */
  export async function placeTile(page: Page, tileTestId: string, x: number, y: number) {
      await page.getByTestId(tileTestId).click();
      await clickCanvas(page, x, y);
      await page.waitForTimeout(100); // Wait for render
  }

  /**
   * Get current zoom value from toolbar or status bar
   */
  export async function getZoomValue(page: Page, source: 'toolbar' | 'statusbar' = 'toolbar'): Promise<number> {
      const testId = source === 'toolbar' ? 'zoom-level' : 'statusbar-zoom-display';
      const text = await page.getByTestId(testId).textContent();
      return parseInt(text?.replace('%', '') || '100', 10);
  }

  /**
   * Get total object count from status bar
   */
  export async function getObjectCount(page: Page): Promise<number> {
      const statusText = await page.getByTestId('selection-count').textContent();
      const match = statusText?.match(/(\d+) object/);
      return match ? parseInt(match[1], 10) : 0;
  }

  /**
   * Select a tool by test ID
   */
  export async function selectTool(page: Page, tool: 'select' | 'multiselect' | 'move' | 'line' | 'rectangle' | 'link') {
      await page.getByTestId(`button-tool-${tool}`).click();
  }

  /**
   * Select and place an object (tile, interactable, or spawn point)
   */
  export async function placeObject(page: Page, objectType: string, x: number, y: number) {
      await page.getByText(objectType, { exact: true }).click();
      await clickCanvas(page, x, y);
      await page.waitForTimeout(100);
  }

  /**
   * Get canvas bounding box
   */
  export async function getCanvasBounds(page: Page) {
      const canvas = page.getByTestId('level-canvas');
      const box = await canvas.boundingBox();
      if (!box) throw new Error('Canvas not found');
      return box;
  }
  ```
- **What was implemented:**
  - ✅ Created `e2e/helpers.ts` with 6 utility functions
  - ✅ Refactored 3 passing tests as proof of concept:
    - "Step 10: should place single platform tile with click" (line 869)
    - "Step 9: should enforce minimum zoom of 10%" (line 740)
    - "Step 10: should place spawn point object" (line 920)
  - ✅ All 113 passing E2E tests still pass (verified)
  - ✅ Reduced boilerplate by ~40 lines in 3 refactored tests
- **Helper functions implemented:**
  - `clickCanvas(page, x, y)` - Click at canvas coordinates
  - `getCanvasBounds(page)` - Get canvas bounding box with error handling
  - `placeTile(page, tileTestId, x, y)` - Select tile + click canvas + wait
  - `selectTool(page, tool)` - Select tool by name
  - `getZoomValue(page, source?)` - Extract zoom percentage
  - `getObjectCount(page)` - Extract object count from status bar
- **Files created:** `e2e/helpers.ts`
- **Files modified:** `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts` (3 tests refactored)
- **Impact:** -40 lines in 3 tests, demonstrates pattern for Task 13.11 (~250-350 total lines saved when all tests refactored per ast-grep analysis)
- **Manual Test:**
  - Run `npm run test:e2e` - verify all 113 passing tests still pass
  - Verify refactored tests are more readable (less boilerplate)

#### 13.11 Refactor existing tests to use helper functions ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-06)
- **Location:** 7 out of 13 E2E test files refactored (4 files had no refactorable patterns)
- **Implementation Approach:**
  - Started with manual refactoring of `visual-effects.spec.ts` (highest impact)
  - Partial manual work on `selection.spec.ts` (5 of 14 tests)
  - Switched to parallel execution strategy using 6 concurrent Task agents
  - Each agent refactored one file independently
  - Verified 4 remaining files had no refactorable patterns
- **Refactored Patterns:**
  ```typescript
  // BEFORE (repeated 171 times across 11 files):
  const canvas = page.getByTestId('level-canvas');
  const box = await canvas.boundingBox();
  if (!box) throw new Error('Canvas not found');
  await page.mouse.click(box.x + 200, box.y + 200);

  // Object count extraction (36 instances):
  const statusText = await page.getByTestId('statusbar-object-count').textContent();
  const count = parseInt(statusText?.match(/\d+/)?.[0] || '0', 10);

  // AFTER (using helpers):
  import { clickCanvas, getObjectCount, getCanvasBounds } from './helpers';

  await clickCanvas(page, 200, 200);
  const count = await getObjectCount(page);
  ```
- **Files Refactored:**
  1. ✅ `visual-effects.spec.ts` - 24 manual clicks, 12 object count extractions → helpers
  2. ✅ `selection.spec.ts` - 23 manual clicks, 9 object count extractions → helpers
  3. ✅ `undo-redo.spec.ts` - 6 manual clicks, 10 object count extractions → helpers
  4. ✅ `copy-paste.spec.ts` - 9 manual clicks, 3 object count extractions → helpers
  5. ✅ `auto-save.spec.ts` - 3 manual clicks → helpers
  6. ✅ `basic-ui.spec.ts` - 2 boundingBox patterns → helpers
  7. ✅ `import-export.spec.ts` - 1 manual click, 3 object count extractions → helpers
- **Files Verified (No Refactoring Needed):**
  - `keyboard-shortcuts.spec.ts` - Pure keyboard event testing, no canvas interactions
  - `menus.spec.ts` - Pure menu interaction testing, no canvas clicks
  - `parallax-zoom.spec.ts` - Zoom/viewport testing, no refactorable patterns
  - `toolbar.spec.ts` - Toolbar UI testing, no canvas interactions
  - `tile-placement.spec.ts` - Already using helpers
  - `zoom-pan.spec.ts` - Already using helpers
- **Test Results:** All 123 E2E tests passing (4 skipped), 100% success rate
- **Impact:** Estimated -250 to -300 lines through code reuse, significantly improved maintainability
- **Implementation Time:** ~2 hours (parallel execution reduced from estimated 8-12 hours)

### Phase 4: Add Missing Coverage (Low Priority)

#### 13.12 Add error handling and edge case tests
- **Location:** `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts` (new tests to add)
- **Missing Coverage:**
  1. **Network Errors:**
     - Import JSON with network failure
     - Corrupt localStorage recovery
     - Invalid tile data handling
  2. **Edge Cases:**
     - Copy/paste with 0 objects selected
     - Zoom during active drag operation
     - Pan beyond canvas boundaries
     - Undo/redo across level switches
  3. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
     - Delete key (only animation tested currently)
     - Ctrl+A (select all) - not implemented or tested
     - Arrow keys for object movement
  4. **Cross-Level Operations:**
     - Copy from one level, paste to another
     - Undo/redo state preservation across level switches
  5. **Performance:**
     - Large canvas with 1000+ objects
     - Rapid tool switching
     - Memory leaks on level close
- **Implementation:** Add 8-12 new targeted tests
- **Files to modify:** `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts`
- **Impact:** +12 tests, +300 lines (but filling critical gaps)

**Dependencies:** Phase 3 (helpers) should be completed before Phase 4 to avoid more boilerplate
**Notes:**
- ✅ Phase 1 & 2 complete (-9 tests, -277 lines total)
- 🔄 Phase 3: Task 13.10 complete (helpers created), Task 13.11 not started (171 patterns to refactor, -250 to -350 lines potential)
- Phase 3 is LARGER than originally estimated - ast-grep analysis revealed 171 refactorable patterns across 11 files
- Phase 4 remains low priority (add missing coverage)

---

## Chapter 15: Code Quality & Refactoring

**Status:** ⏸️ Not Started
**Files:** Various
**Priority:** Medium

### Tasks:

#### 15.1 Fix all linter issues
- **Priority:** 3 (Feature)
- **Location:** Multiple files across codebase
- **Current:** Biome linter reports warnings for excessive cognitive complexity and other issues
- **Known issues:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - 3 functions with excessive complexity (26, 17, 38)
    - `handleMouseMove` - complexity 26 (max 15)
    - `handleMouseDown` - complexity 17 (max 15)
    - `handleMouseUp` - complexity 38 (max 15)
  - `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx` - `LevelEditor` function complexity 23 (max 15)
- **Change:** Refactor complex functions to reduce cognitive complexity below threshold (15)
- **Implementation approach:**
  - Extract helper functions from complex handlers
  - Break down conditional logic into smaller, named functions
  - Consider state machine pattern for tool/mode handling
  - Use early returns to reduce nesting
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Refactor mouse handlers
  - `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx` - Refactor LevelEditor component
  - Any other files with linter warnings
- **Tests:**
  - Ensure all unit tests still pass after refactoring
  - Ensure all E2E tests still pass
  - No behavioral changes - pure refactoring
- **Note:** This improves code maintainability and makes future changes easier

**Dependencies:** None
**Notes:** Can be done incrementally - start with highest complexity functions first

## Chapter 14: E2E Test Organization & Splitting

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Files:** `e2e/*.spec.ts` (13 files created from monolithic file)
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Split monolithic level-editor.spec.ts into focused test files organized by feature area. Each file should cover specific functionality with clear behavioral documentation. Must handle Playwright parallel execution properly. All tests passing before and after split - this is purely a refactoring/reorganization task.

### Tasks:

#### 14.1 Split E2E tests into focused files by functionality ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Commit 42e59bb
- **Location:** `e2e/level-editor.spec.ts` (3240 lines → deleted)
- **Completed:** Split into 13 focused test files organized by feature area
- **Files created:**
  - ✅ `e2e/basic-ui.spec.ts` - Initial load, tile palette, level tabs, properties panel
  - ✅ `e2e/toolbar.spec.ts` - Toolbar buttons, tool selection, toggles
  - ✅ `e2e/keyboard-shortcuts.spec.ts` - All keyboard shortcuts (V/M/H/L/R/K/P/Escape)
  - ✅ `e2e/zoom-pan.spec.ts` - Zoom controls, pan with middle mouse, viewport interactions
  - ✅ `e2e/tile-placement.spec.ts` - Single click, painting mode, spawn points, interactables
  - ✅ `e2e/selection.spec.ts` - Select tool, multi-select, move tool, ghost preview, line drawing
  - ✅ `e2e/undo-redo.spec.ts` - Undo/redo operations, history display, button states
  - ✅ `e2e/copy-paste.spec.ts` - Copy/paste operations, clipboard management
  - ✅ `e2e/import-export.spec.ts` - JSON import/export, PNG export, validation
  - ✅ `e2e/auto-save.spec.ts` - Auto-save timing, save indicators, unsaved state
  - ✅ `e2e/visual-effects.spec.ts` - Scanlines, grid toggle, selection feedback, delete animations
  - ✅ `e2e/parallax-zoom.spec.ts` - Initial zoom calculation, parallax background
  - ✅ `e2e/menus.spec.ts` - File dropdown, menu actions
- **Results:**
  - All 123 tests preserved exactly as-is (pure refactoring)
  - All tests passing (4 skipped)
  - Improved maintainability - focused files by feature area
  - Better Playwright parallel execution
  - Easier navigation and reduced cognitive load

**Dependencies:** None
**Notes:** Improves test maintainability and parallel execution. Each file becomes focused and easier to navigate.

## Chapter 17: E2E Test Optimization - Phase 3

**Status:** ⏸️ Not Started
**Files:** `e2e/auto-save.spec.ts`, `e2e/tile-placement.spec.ts`
**Priority:** Low

**Goal:** Continue E2E test consolidation from Chapter 13 with additional redundant test removal.

### Tasks:

#### 17.1 Merge auto-save E2E tests
- **Status:** ⏸️ Not Started
- **Priority:** 3 (Test consolidation)
- **Location:** `e2e/auto-save.spec.ts`
- **Tests to merge:**
  - Line 32: "should auto-save after 5 seconds"
  - Line 56: "should change icon color based on save state"
- **Reason:** Both tests verify auto-save behavior, can be consolidated into single comprehensive test
- **Pattern:** Follow consolidation pattern from Chapter 13 (undo/redo/copy/paste merges)
- **Implementation:**
  - Merge both tests into single test that verifies timing AND icon state changes
  - Place tiles → wait 5 seconds → verify save occurred + icon state
  - Delete tests → verify icon shows unsaved state
- **Files to modify:**
  - `e2e/auto-save.spec.ts`
- **Impact:** -1 test, reduces E2E execution time

#### 17.2 Remove redundant platform tile placement test
- **Status:** ⏸️ Not Started
- **Priority:** 3 (Test cleanup)
- **Location:** `e2e/tile-placement.spec.ts:9`
- **Test to remove:** "should place single platform tile with click"
- **Reason:** Redundant coverage - single-click placement mechanics already verified by:
  - Line 62: spawn point placement (same click mechanics)
  - Line 81: button placement (same click mechanics)
  - Line 142: undo history for single-click (verifies placement works)
- **Impact:** Reduces E2E execution time without losing coverage
- **Pattern:** Each test should verify unique behavior; object-type-specific tests already cover placement mechanics
- **Files to modify:**
  - `e2e/tile-placement.spec.ts`

---

## Chapter 18: Enhanced Copy/Paste with Ghost Preview

**Status:** ⏸️ Not Started
**Files:** `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`, `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts`, `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts`
**Priority:** Medium

**Goal:** Change paste behavior to show ghost preview instead of immediate placement. Paste becomes a "complex palette mode" similar to other drawing tools.

### Tasks:

#### 15.1 Rethink copy/paste workflow with ghost preview
- **Location:** `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`, `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts`
- **Current:** Paste immediately places tiles at clipboard position
- **Change:** Paste shows ghost preview, waits for click to place
- **New workflow:**
  - **Copy:** Selected tiles → clipboard (unchanged)
  - **Paste:** Show ghost image of tiles, wait for click to place
  - **Placement:** Clicking places tiles at cursor position
  - **Overwrite:** Pasted tiles overwrite overlapping tiles (connects to Task 11.10)
  - **Cancel:** ESC key or selecting other tool/palette cancels paste mode
- **Implementation:**
  - In `useLevelEditor`: Add `pasteMode` state (boolean)
  - In `useCanvas`: On paste, set `pasteMode = true`, store clipboard data in temp state
  - In `canvasRenderer`: Render ghost preview of clipboard tiles at cursor position
  - In `useCanvas`: On click, place tiles from clipboard at clicked position
  - In `useCanvas`: On ESC or tool change, clear `pasteMode`
- **Ghost reuse opportunity:**
  - Currently ghost rendering used in move tool
  - Paste will add another use case
  - Investigate consolidating ghost rendering logic (DRY principle)
  - Possible shared helper: `drawGhostObjects(objects, offset, alpha)`
- **Edge cases to consider:**
  - Copy/paste with 0 objects selected (should show appropriate feedback)
  - Copy from one level, paste to another (should work seamlessly)
  - Undo/redo state preservation during paste mode
  - Paste cancellation (ESC key, tool change, level switch)
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` (add pasteMode state)
  - `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` (paste interaction logic)
  - `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts` (ghost preview rendering)
- **Note:** Paste essentially becomes a "complex palette mode" similar to other drawing tools

**Dependencies:** Task 11.10 (tile overlap logic) should be completed first for consistent overwrite behavior
**Notes:** More intuitive paste workflow. User has control over where pasted content goes.

## Chapter 19: Undo/Redo History Preservation

**Status:** ⏸️ Not Started
**Files:** `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts`
**Priority:** High (P2 - Bugfix)

**Goal:** Fix undo/redo history not being preserved when switching between levels.

### Tasks:

#### 19.1 Fix undo/redo history preservation across level switches
- **Priority:** 2 (Bugfix)
- **Location:** `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` - level switching and history management
- **Current:** When switching between levels, undo/redo history is not preserved for each level
- **Issue:** History state appears to be global instead of per-level, causing loss of undo/redo capability when switching tabs
- **Affected E2E test:**
  - "should preserve undo/redo history when switching between levels" (e2e/undo-redo.spec.ts:275) - FAILING
  - Test expects: Place objects on Level 1 → switch to Level 2 → place objects → switch back to Level 1 → undo should work
  - Actual behavior: Undo does not work after switching back to Level 1
- **Expected behavior:**
  - Each level should maintain its own undo/redo history stack
  - Switching levels should save current level's history and restore target level's history
  - History should be preserved in localStorage along with level data
- **Implementation approach:**
  - Change history storage from single global array to per-level storage (Map or object keyed by levelId)
  - On level switch: Save current level's history state, load target level's history state
  - Update localStorage schema to include history data for each level
  - Ensure historyIndex is also per-level
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` - Refactor history management to be per-level
  - localStorage schema for level data (add history array and historyIndex)
- **Tests:**
  - Verify E2E test passes after fix
  - Manual test: Create actions on multiple levels, switch between them, verify undo/redo works on each
- **Note:** This is a critical UX bug affecting multi-level workflows

**Dependencies:** None
**Notes:** Discovered during E2E test run on 2025-10-06. Currently blocking 1 E2E test.

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture:
- **Framework:** React + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + custom CSS
- **Components:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)
- **State:** Custom hooks (useLevelEditor, useCanvas)
- **Canvas:** HTML Canvas API with CanvasRenderer class

### Key Files:
- `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx` - Main layout
- `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` - State management
- `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Canvas interaction
- `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts` - Drawing logic
- `client/src/types/level.ts` - Type definitions
- `client/src/index.css` - Global styles

### Important Classes/Patterns:
- Dark theme throughout (dark gray backgrounds)
- Primary color: Blue (hsl(217 91% 60%))
- Border color: hsl(0 0% 23%)
- All interactive elements have transitions
- Font Awesome icons used for UI icons
- Custom SVG icons for tools and tiles

### Performance Considerations:
- Canvas redraws on every state change
- Keep animations GPU-accelerated (transform, opacity)
- Use will-change for animated elements
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations
