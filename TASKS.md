## Chapter 22: Future Enhancements (P4 - Ideas)

**Status:** ⏭️ Skipped
**Files:** Various
**Priority:** Low (P4 - Ideas)

### Tasks:

#### 22.1 Enhance zoom reset to fit all content ⏭️ SKIPPED
- **Status:** ⏭️ SKIPPED - Not needed for current scope
- **Priority:** 4 (Idea/enhancement)
- **Location:** Zoom reset function in `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` or zoom control handlers
- **Current:** Reset zoom sets to 100% regardless of content
- **Change:** Calculate zoom level that fits all placed content on screen (fit-to-view)
- **Implementation:**
  - Calculate bounding box of all placed objects (tiles, interactables, spawn points)
  - Determine zoom level that fits entire bounding box within viewport
  - Account for padding/margins (e.g., 10% margin around content)
  - If no objects placed, reset to 100% (current behavior)
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` or zoom control handlers
  - `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts` (if zoom calculation logic exists there)
- **Tests:**
  - E2E test: Place objects → zoom reset → verify all objects visible
  - Unit test: Verify zoom calculation for various object layouts
- **Note:** Makes zoom reset more intelligent and useful for level design workflow. Tricky to implement correctly.

**Dependencies:** None
**Notes:** Low priority ideas that would be nice to have but not critical for core functionality

## Chapter 23: Cleanup & Feature Removal

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Files:** `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx`, `client/src/components/level-editor/Toolbar.tsx`, `client/src/types/level.ts`, `client/src/index.css`
**Priority:** Medium (P3)

### Tasks:

#### 23.1 Remove scanline feature ✅ COMPLETE
- **Priority:** 3 (Feature)
- **Location:** Toolbar, EditorState, CSS
- **Current:** Scanline toggle exists in toolbar with showScanlines state and CSS overlay
- **Change:** Remove scanline feature completely (toggle switch, state, CSS, overlay rendering)
- **Implementation:**
  - Remove scanline toggle switch from Toolbar component
  - Remove `showScanlines` from `EditorState` type definition
  - Remove scanline overlay rendering from LevelEditor layout
  - Remove `.scanlines-overlay` CSS class and `@keyframes scanlines` animation
  - Update all references/tests that use `showScanlines`
- **Files to modify:**
  - `client/src/components/level-editor/Toolbar.tsx` - Remove switch and label
  - `client/src/types/level.ts` - Remove `showScanlines` from EditorState
  - `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx` - Remove scanline overlay div and conditional rendering
  - `client/src/index.css` - Remove `.scanlines-overlay` class and animation
  - Any test files that reference scanline toggle
- **Tests:**
  - Verify scanline toggle is removed from UI
  - Verify no scanline overlay renders on canvas
  - Check that grid toggle still works (ensure we didn't break neighboring toggle)
  - Run all unit and E2E tests to ensure no regressions
- **Note:** Clean removal of unused feature to simplify UI and reduce complexity

**Dependencies:** None
**Notes:** Simplifies the UI by removing a visual effect that may not be needed

<!-- CHAPTER_START: 24 -->
## Chapter 24: Playable Levels - Game Mode Implementation

**Status:** ⏸️ Not Started
**Files:** `client/src/components/play-mode/`, `client/src/game/`, `client/src/types/game.ts`
**Priority:** High (P1 - Core Feature)

**Goal:** Implement playable game mode where users can test their levels with player movement, physics, enemies, and win/lose conditions. Build as vertical slices - each slice fully functional before moving to next.

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Play Mode Integration:** Separate route `/play/:levelId` OR overlay mode on editor (TBD in 24.1)
- **Physics Engine:** Custom lightweight AABB collision (~100 LOC)
- **Rendering:** Reuse `CanvasRenderer` with game object extensions
- **State Management:** New `usePlayMode` hook with game loop (requestAnimationFrame)

---

### Slice 1: Basic Player Movement ✅ COMPLETE

**What was delivered:**
- ✅ Player class with position, dimensions, velocity (`client/src/game/Player.ts`)
- ✅ Keyboard input handler for ArrowKeys/WASD (`client/src/game/InputHandler.ts`)
- ✅ Horizontal movement with velocity-based physics
- ✅ AABB collision detection system (`client/src/game/collision.ts`)
- ✅ Platform collision resolution (player doesn't fall through platforms)
- ✅ PlayMode component with edit/play toggle (overlay mode)
- ✅ Game loop with requestAnimationFrame, player rendering, input handling
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (Player.test.ts, InputHandler.test.ts, collision.test.ts)
- ✅ E2E tests (play-mode-toggle.spec.ts, player-movement.spec.ts)
- ✅ All tests passing: 235 unit tests, 177 E2E tests

**Key files:**
- `client/src/game/Player.ts` - Player entity
- `client/src/game/InputHandler.ts` - Keyboard handling
- `client/src/game/collision.ts` - AABB collision utilities
- `client/src/components/play-mode/PlayMode.tsx` - Game canvas and loop

**Result:** Player can move left/right with arrow keys, collides with platforms, render as blue square on canvas.

---

### Slice 2: Jumping & Gravity

**Completed Foundation Work:**
- ✅ Gravity physics system (constant, applyGravity function)
- ✅ Jump input handling (spacebar/W key detection)
- ✅ Jump mechanics (upward velocity, grounded state tracking)
- ✅ Vertical collision detection (ceiling/floor resolution)
- ✅ Unit tests for all physics, jump, and collision logic

#### 24.2 Complete Jump & Gravity Integration ⏸️ Not Started
- **Priority:** High (P1 - Core Feature)
- **Locations:**
  - `client/src/game/physics.ts` - Tune constants
  - `client/src/components/play-mode/PlayMode.tsx` - Wire up jump input
  - `e2e/play-mode/player-jump.spec.ts` - E2E tests
- **Implementation:**
  1. Wire up spacebar/W jump input to game loop (connect InputHandler to Player.jump())
  2. Integrate gravity application to player in game loop
  3. Integrate vertical collision resolution with platforms
  4. Tune GRAVITY (currently 800 px/s²) and JUMP_VELOCITY (currently -400 px/s) for good game feel
  5. Test jumping: Should feel responsive, arc should look natural, landing should be smooth
- **E2E Tests:** Create `e2e/play-mode/player-jump.spec.ts`:
  - Player can jump with spacebar and W key
  - Player jumps in realistic arc with gravity
  - Player lands smoothly on platforms
  - Player can jump over gaps
  - Player hits ceiling and falls back down
  - Player cannot jump while in air (no double jump)
- **Verification:**
  - Run `npm test && npm run test:e2e && npm run lint:fix`
  - Manually test jump feel (height, arc, responsiveness)
- **Estimated:** ~150 LOC (game loop integration + E2E tests + tuning)

  - `client/src/game/Player.test.ts` - Unit tests for health/death/respawn
  - `client/src/game/collision.test.ts` - Unit tests for lava collision
- **Implementation:**
  1. Add health system to Player class:
     - `health` property (default 3, max 3)
     - `takeDamage(amount)` method - reduces health, triggers death if health <= 0
     - `isDead()` method - returns true if health <= 0
     - `isDying` state - for death animation (optional)
  2. Add death and respawn logic:
     - `die()` method - sets isDying state, stops input
     - `respawn(spawnPoint)` method - resets position to spawn point, restores health to 3
  3. Add lava collision detection:
     - `checkLavaCollision(tiles)` function in collision.ts
     - Checks if player overlaps tile with material type "lava"
     - Returns true if player touches lava
  4. Wire up lava damage in game loop:
     - Check lava collision each frame
     - Call `player.takeDamage(3)` on lava touch (instant death)
     - Call `player.respawn(spawnPoint)` when player dies
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Player.test.ts: Health state (initial 3, max 3), takeDamage reduces health, isDead when health <= 0
  - Player.test.ts: Death state, respawn resets position and health
  - collision.test.ts: Lava detection when player overlaps lava tile
  - collision.test.ts: No lava collision on regular tiles
- **Verification:**
  - Run `npm test && npm run test:e2e && npm run lint:fix`

- **Implementation:**
  1. Create Hearts UI component:
     - Display 3 heart icons in top-left corner
     - Filled hearts for current health (red/pink)
     - Empty hearts for lost health (gray outline)
     - Props: `health` (current), `maxHealth` (default 3)
     - Use Font Awesome heart icons or custom SVG
  2. Integrate Hearts into PlayMode:
     - Render Hearts component on top of canvas
     - Pass player.health as prop
     - Position in top-left with padding (absolute positioning)
  3. Visual polish:
     - Heart animation on damage (shake/pulse)
     - Death screen overlay (optional - "You Died" message)
- **Component Tests (Hearts.test.tsx):**
  - Renders 3 hearts with full health
  - Shows correct filled/empty hearts based on health (3/3, 2/3, 1/3, 0/3)
  - Accepts custom maxHealth prop
- **E2E Tests (death-respawn.spec.ts):**
  - Create level with lava tile and spawn point
  - Enter play mode
  - Verify 3 hearts visible

  - `client/src/game/Player.ts` - Damage system integration
  - `client/src/game/Enemy.test.ts` - Enemy unit tests
  - `client/src/game/collision.test.ts` - Collision unit tests
  - `client/src/game/Player.test.ts` - Damage tests
- **Implementation:**
  1. Create Enemy class:
     - Position (x, y), dimensions (width, height), velocity (vx, vy)
     - `isAlive` property (default true)
     - `kill()` method - sets isAlive to false
     - `update(deltaTime)` method - placeholder for AI (Slice 5)
  2. Add player-enemy collision detection:
     - `checkEnemyCollision(player, enemy)` function in collision.ts
     - AABB overlap check between player and enemy rectangles
     - Returns collision info: `{ collided: boolean, fromTop: boolean }`
  3. Add directional collision logic:
     - Determine if collision from top (stomp) or side (damage)
     - Use player vertical velocity: if `vy > 0` (falling) and player bottom near enemy top → stomp
     - Otherwise → side collision (damage)
  4. Implement damage system:
     - Player already has `takeDamage(amount)` from Slice 3
     - Side collision: `player.takeDamage(1)` (lose 1 heart)
  5. Implement enemy death on stomp:
     - Top collision: `enemy.kill()` (sets isAlive to false)
     - Player bounces slightly upward (small negative vy)
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Enemy.test.ts: Enemy creation, kill() sets isAlive to false
  - collision.test.ts: Player-enemy AABB collision detection
  - collision.test.ts: Directional collision (top vs side) based on velocity and position
  - Player.test.ts: Side collision reduces health by 1 (already tested in Slice 3)
- **Verification:**
  - Run `npm test && npm run test:e2e && npm run lint:fix`
  - All tests pass (unit + e2e, ensure no regressions)
- **Estimated:** ~200 LOC

#### 24.4.2 Implement Invulnerability & Game Loop Integration ⏸️ Not Started
- **Priority:** High (P1 - Core Feature)
- **Locations:**
  - `client/src/game/Player.ts` - Invulnerability system
  - `client/src/components/play-mode/PlayMode.tsx` - Game loop integration
  - `client/src/game/Player.test.ts` - Invulnerability unit tests
  - `e2e/play-mode/enemy-collision.spec.ts` - E2E tests
- **Implementation:**
  1. Add invulnerability system to Player:
     - `isInvulnerable` property (default false)
     - `invulnerabilityTimer` property (seconds remaining)
     - `INVULNERABILITY_DURATION` constant (e.g., 1.5 seconds)
     - Update `takeDamage(amount)`:
       - If `isInvulnerable`, return early (no damage)
       - Otherwise, reduce health and set `isInvulnerable = true`, `invulnerabilityTimer = INVULNERABILITY_DURATION`
     - Update `update(deltaTime)`:
       - If `isInvulnerable`, decrease `invulnerabilityTimer`
       - If timer reaches 0, set `isInvulnerable = false`
  2. Add visual feedback for invulnerability:
     - In PlayMode rendering, flash player sprite (toggle visibility every 100ms)
     - Use `isInvulnerable` state to determine flashing
  3. Wire up enemy collision in game loop:
     - Load enemies from level data (spawn points with type "enemy")
     - Each frame:
       - Update all enemies (position, AI - placeholder for Slice 5)
       - Check collision between player and each enemy
       - If collision from top: `enemy.kill()`, player bounces
       - If collision from side: `player.takeDamage(1)` (respects invulnerability)
     - Remove dead enemies from game state
  4. Enemy rendering:
     - Render enemies as colored rectangles (e.g., red for zombie)
     - Don't render if `!enemy.isAlive`
- **Unit Tests (Player.test.ts):**
  - After taking damage, player is invulnerable
  - Player cannot take damage while invulnerable
  - Invulnerability expires after duration
  - Invulnerability timer decrements correctly
- **E2E Tests (enemy-collision.spec.ts):**
  - Create level with player spawn, enemy spawn (zombie), and platform
  - Enter play mode
  - Test 1: Walk into enemy from side
    - Verify player loses 1 heart
    - Verify player flashes (invulnerable)
    - Verify player cannot lose another heart immediately
  - Test 2: Jump on top of enemy
    - Verify enemy dies (disappears)
    - Verify player bounces slightly
    - Verify player health unchanged
  - Test 3: Stomp all enemies
    - Verify dead enemies no longer collide
- **Verification:**
  - Run `npm test && npm run test:e2e && npm run lint:fix`
  - Visual test: Player flashes when invulnerable, enemies die on stomp
- **Estimated:** ~150 LOC

### Slice 5: Enemy AI Movement

#### 24.5.1 Implement Enemy Patrol AI ⏸️ Not Started
- **Priority:** High (P1 - Core Feature)
- **Locations:**
  - `client/src/game/Enemy.ts` - Patrol AI logic
  - `client/src/game/Enemy.test.ts` - AI unit tests
- **Implementation:**
  1. Add movement to Enemy class:
     - `direction` property: "left" | "right" (patrol direction)
     - `PATROL_SPEED` constant (e.g., 60 px/s)
     - Update `update(deltaTime, tiles)`:
       - Apply horizontal velocity based on direction (`vx = direction === "left" ? -PATROL_SPEED : PATROL_SPEED`)
       - Apply gravity (reuse `applyGravity` from physics.ts)
       - Update position based on velocity
  2. Add platform edge detection:
     - Lookahead check: Cast ray downward from front edge of enemy (1 tile ahead)
     - If no ground detected below → edge detected
     - Reverse direction: `direction = direction === "left" ? "right" : "left"`
  3. Add wall collision detection:
     - Check for tile collision ahead of enemy (horizontal AABB check)
     - If tile detected → wall collision
     - Reverse direction
  4. Patrol state machine:
     - States: "patrolLeft", "patrolRight"
     - `reverseDirection()` method - toggles between states, reverses velocity
     - Called on edge detection or wall collision
- **Unit Tests (Enemy.test.ts):**
  - Enemy moves left/right with velocity based on direction
  - Gravity applies to enemies (vy increases over time)
  - Enemy detects platform edge and reverses direction
  - Enemy detects wall collision and reverses direction
  - Enemy patrol state machine (patrolLeft ↔ patrolRight)
  - Enemy respects platform boundaries
- **Verification:**
  - Run `npm test && npm run test:e2e && npm run lint:fix`
  - All tests pass (unit + e2e, ensure no regressions)
- **Estimated:** ~200 LOC

#### 24.5.2 Integrate Enemy AI & Complete Playable Level ⏸️ Not Started
- **Priority:** High (P1 - Core Feature)
- **Locations:**
  - `client/src/components/play-mode/PlayMode.tsx` - Enemy AI integration
  - `e2e/play-mode/enemy-ai.spec.ts` - E2E tests
- **Implementation:**
  1. Wire up enemy AI in game loop (PlayMode.tsx):
     - Each frame, call `enemy.update(deltaTime, tiles)` for all living enemies
     - Enemies apply their own physics (gravity, movement)
     - Enemies detect edges and walls, reverse direction
  2. Enemy-tile collision integration:
     - Enemies should collide with platforms (don't fall through)
     - Reuse platform collision logic from Player
  3. Visual polish:
     - Enemies render with distinct color (red for zombie)
     - Optional: Add simple sprite animation (flip sprite based on direction)
  4. Final testing and tuning:
     - Adjust PATROL_SPEED for good game feel
     - Ensure enemies don't get stuck
     - Verify enemies respect level boundaries
- **E2E Tests (enemy-ai.spec.ts):**
  - Create level with platform, enemy spawn, player spawn
  - Enter play mode
  - Test 1: Enemy patrols platform
    - Verify enemy moves left/right
    - Verify enemy stays on platform
  - Test 2: Enemy turns at platform edge
    - Enemy reaches edge
    - Verify enemy reverses direction
    - Verify enemy doesn't fall off
  - Test 3: Enemy turns at wall
    - Place wall in enemy path
    - Verify enemy hits wall and reverses
  - Test 4: Multiple enemies patrol independently
    - Spawn 2+ enemies on different platforms
    - Verify each enemy patrols independently
- **Final Verification:**
  - Run `npm test && npm run test:e2e && npm run lint:fix`
  - Full test suite passes
  - Manual playtest: Complete level with player movement, jumping, enemies, health, death/respawn
- **Estimated:** ~100 LOC

**🎉 Upon completion: Full playable level with physics, enemies, health, and win/lose conditions!**

---

**Notes:**
- Each task delivers a complete, working feature (not micro-steps)
- TDD approach: Write tests and implementation together in same commit
- Run both unit tests (`npm test`) and E2E tests (`npm run test:e2e`) before marking complete
- Start with simple colored rectangles for sprites, add art later
- Physics tuning (jump height, gravity, patrol speed) happens during implementation

**Task Summary:**
- **Slice 1**: Basic Player Movement - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Slice 2**: Jumping & Gravity - **1 task remaining** (24.2)
- **Slice 3**: Death & Respawn - **2 tasks remaining** (24.3.1, 24.3.2)
- **Slice 4**: Enemy Collision - **2 tasks remaining** (24.4.1, 24.4.2)
- **Slice 5**: Enemy AI Movement - **2 tasks remaining** (24.5.1, 24.5.2)

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture:
- **Framework:** React + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + custom CSS
- **Components:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)
- **State:** Custom hooks (useLevelEditor, useCanvas)
- **Canvas:** HTML Canvas API with CanvasRenderer class

### Key Files:
- `client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx` - Main layout
- `client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts` - State management
- `client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Canvas interaction
- `client/src/utils/canvasRenderer.ts` - Drawing logic
- `client/src/types/level.ts` - Type definitions
- `client/src/index.css` - Global styles

### Important Classes/Patterns:
- Dark theme throughout (dark gray backgrounds)
- Primary color: Blue (hsl(217 91% 60%))
- Border color: hsl(0 0% 23%)
- All interactive elements have transitions
- Font Awesome icons used for UI icons
- Custom SVG icons for tools and tiles

### Performance Considerations:
- Canvas redraws on every state change
- Keep animations GPU-accelerated (transform, opacity)
- Use will-change for animated elements
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations
