You are running in FULL AUTO MODE. Complete the next task from TASKS.md autonomously.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Run /next to get next incomplete task (skip ⏭️ SKIPPED tasks)
2. DO NOT ask questions - make reasonable assumptions
3. Log ALL decisions to docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md:
   ```
   ## Task [N.X]: [Task Name]
   **Question:** [What you would have asked]
   **Assumption/Decision:** [What you decided and why]
   ---
   ```
4. Follow docs/TASK_MANAGEMENT.md workflow (TDD, testing, commits)
5. Follow docs/TDD_PRINCIPLES.md (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
6. Run npm test && npm run test:e2e before committing
7. Mark task "✅ COMPLETE" when done
8. After commit: EXIT session immediately

BEGIN NOW. Run /next and complete task. After commit, EXIT.
