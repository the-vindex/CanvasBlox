# Move Tool Implementation Status

## Current Status (as of commit 687a2b2)

**Move Tool: ✅ IMPLEMENTED** - Ready for testing

### What's Working:
- ✅ Move tool activated with `H` key or Move button in toolbar
- ✅ Drag selected objects to new positions
- ✅ Works with tiles, objects, and spawn points
- ✅ Supports single and multiple object moves
- ✅ All selected objects move together (maintains relative positions)
- ✅ Undo support - moves added to history with descriptive messages
- ✅ Safety: Only works when objects are selected

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:

1. **client/src/hooks/useCanvas.ts**
   - Added refs for move tracking:
     - `isMovingObjectsRef` - tracks if currently moving
     - `moveStartPositionRef` - initial click position
     - `moveDeltaRef` - movement delta
   - Added `onMoveObjectsComplete` callback to interface
   - Updated `handleMouseDown` to start move drag when move tool active + objects selected
   - Updated `handleMouseMove` to track delta during drag
   - Updated `handleMouseUp` to complete move and call callback

2. **client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts**
   - Added `moveSelectedObjects(delta: Position)` function
   - Updates positions of all selected tiles, objects, and spawn points
   - Creates history entry: "Moved X object(s)"
   - Exported in return statement

3. **client/src/pages/LevelEditor.tsx**
   - Imported `moveSelectedObjects` from useLevelEditor
   - Added `handleMoveObjectsComplete` callback that calls `_moveSelectedObjects(delta)`
   - Passed callback to Canvas component

4. **client/src/components/level-editor/Canvas.tsx**
   - Added `onMoveObjectsComplete` to interface
   - Passed through to useCanvas hook

5. **e2e/level-editor.spec.ts**
   - Added 3 E2E tests for move functionality:
     - "Step 11B: should move selected objects with move tool"
     - "Step 11B: should move multiple selected objects together"
     - "Step 11B: should not move when no objects selected"

## How Move Tool Works (User Perspective)

### Basic Usage:
1. **Place objects**: Use tile palette to place tiles/objects
2. **Select objects**:
   - Press `V` (select tool) and click objects, OR
   - Press `M` (multi-select tool) and drag box over objects
3. **Activate move tool**: Press `H` or click Move button
4. **Drag**: Click on selected object and drag to new position
5. **Release**: Drop objects at new position
6. **Undo**: Press `Ctrl+Z` to undo the move

### Technical Flow:
1. User presses `H` → `editorState.selectedTool = 'move'`
2. User clicks on canvas with selected objects → `isMovingObjectsRef.current = true`
3. User drags → `moveDeltaRef` tracks offset from start position
4. User releases → `onMoveObjectsComplete(delta)` called
5. `moveSelectedObjects` updates all selected item positions
6. History entry created for undo/redo

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ No known bugs
- ✅ TypeScript passes
- ✅ Linter clean
- ✅ E2E tests added

### Potential Enhancements (Future):
- [ ] Visual preview during drag (ghost/outline of objects at new position)
- [ ] Snap to grid during move
- [ ] Prevent moving objects outside canvas bounds
- [ ] Arrow key nudging for fine-tuned positioning
- [ ] Show delta/offset tooltip during drag

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:
- [ ] Test moving single tile
- [ ] Test moving single object (button/door)
- [ ] Test moving spawn point
- [ ] Test moving multiple objects together
- [ ] Test move + undo
- [ ] Test move when nothing selected (should do nothing)
- [ ] Test switching between select/move/multiselect tools
- [ ] Test move with zoom/pan active
- [ ] Test move with scrollbars

### E2E Tests (Automated):
- ✅ Move single object
- ✅ Move multiple objects
- ✅ No action when nothing selected

- `isMovingObjectsRef` - boolean tracking if currently dragging
- `moveStartPositionRef` - Position where drag started
- `moveDeltaRef` - Position delta from start

## Next Steps

### If Move Tool Works:
1. Mark Step 11 complete in FEATURE_RESTORATION_PLAN.md
2. Continue with next feature (likely Step 12: Undo/Redo or Step 13: Copy/Paste)

### If Issues Found:
1. Document the specific issue
2. Create failing test if possible
3. Fix the issue
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Commit fix

## Development Environment

- TypeScript: ✅ Passing
- Linter: ✅ Clean (2 warnings in shadcn components - acceptable)
- Branch: `feature/working-scrollbars`
