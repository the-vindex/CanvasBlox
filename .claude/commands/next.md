# /next

Implement the next step from the Feature Restoration Plan.

mode: plan

## Usage

```
/next
```

## Instructions

When this command is invoked:

1. **Read** `FEATURE_RESTORATION_PLAN.md`
2. **Find** the first step with status: â¬œ Not Started
3. **Implement** that step following the **TDD workflow from CLAUDE.md**:
   - âœ… Write failing tests first (BOTH unit AND e2e)
   - âœ… Implement feature to make tests pass
   - âœ… Verify all tests pass: `npm test && npm run test:e2e`
   - âœ… **Run `/review-tests [scope]`** to check test quality
   - âœ… Refactor tests based on review feedback
   - âœ… Run tests again to verify refactoring
   - âœ… Commit code + tests together
   - âœ… Push to remote: `git push`
4. **Update** the step's status to: ðŸ§ª Ready for User Testing
5. **Report** to the user:
   - Which step was implemented
   - What files were changed
   - What they need to manually test (from the "Manual Test" section)
   - Reminder to run `/next` again after testing to continue

## When User Confirms Testing

When the user tells you the step is tested/working:
- Update that step's status from ðŸ§ª to âœ… Complete
- Acknowledge completion
- Ask if they want to continue with `/next`

## Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Follow the complete TDD workflow from CLAUDE.md (see step 3 above)
- **CRITICAL**: Always run `/review-tests [scope]` BEFORE committing
- Follow all implementation details from the step
- Preserve scrollbar functionality
- Check and respect step dependencies
- Run BOTH unit tests AND e2e tests every time (never skip either one)
