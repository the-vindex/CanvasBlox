## Step 11.16: Improve close level dialog message

**Question:** Should we replace `window.confirm()` with shadcn AlertDialog component for better styling (red/warning theme)?

**Assumption/Decision:** Keep `window.confirm()` for now, but improve the message text for clarity.

**Reasoning:**
- The current implementation already shows the level name: `"Are you sure you want to close "${level.levelName}"? Any unsaved changes will be lost."`
- This meets the core requirement from the task spec
- Replacing with AlertDialog would require:
  1. Adding state management for dialog open/close
  2. Creating a new reusable CloseLevelDialog component
  3. Refactoring handleLevelClose to be async or callback-based
  4. Updating all E2E tests to handle the new dialog
- Since this is AUTO MODE and the core requirement is met, implementing the minimal viable improvement
- Future enhancement: Could add AlertDialog with destructive variant styling in a separate task

**Implementation:** Enhanced the confirmation message to be more kid-friendly and clearer about data loss.
