## Task 15.1: Fix all linter issues

**Question:** What refactoring approach should I use for complex functions (handleMouseMove, handleMouseDown, handleMouseUp, handleCanvasClick, getRectanglePositions)?

**Assumption/Decision:**
- Extract helper functions from complex handlers to reduce cognitive complexity
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Group related conditional logic into smaller, named functions
- Focus on maintaining exact behavior (no breaking changes)
- Auto-fix simple issues (unused imports, unused variables with underscore prefix, node: protocol)
- Priority order: Auto-fixable issues first, then complex function refactoring
