## 2025-10-05: Split TASKS.md into Multiple Files

**Hypothesis:** Splitting TASKS.md into multiple files (index + chapter files) would reduce token consumption for task management commands.

**Initial claim:** 85% token reduction

**Test methodology:**
- Measured current TASKS.md: 38,730 chars = ~9,682 tokens
- Created test index: 1,065 chars = ~266 tokens
- Measured chapters: Ch11 = 15,368 chars, Ch13 = 12,707 chars

**Actual results:**

| Scenario | Current | Simple Split | Smart Split (priority queue) |
|----------|---------|--------------|------------------------------|
| `/next` | 9,682 tokens | 7,285 tokens (24% savings) | 4,030 tokens (58% savings) |
| `/todo` | 9,682 tokens | 4,108 tokens (58% savings) | 4,108 tokens (58% savings) |

**Simple split:** Index + chapter files, no priority queue
**Smart split:** Index includes priority queue, must stay in sync

**Why `/next` savings are lower:**
- Must read multiple active chapters to find highest priority task (P2 in Ch11 vs P3 in Ch13)
- Can't know which chapter has highest priority without reading them

**Decision: NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Reasoning:**
- 24-58% savings not worth the complexity for current backlog size (~786 lines)
- Would make sense for massive backlogs (thousands of tasks)
- Adds file management overhead (5-6 files instead of 1)
- Smart split requires keeping priority queue in sync (error-prone)
- Current single-file approach is simpler and adequate

**Threshold for reconsideration:** If TASKS.md exceeds 2,000 lines or 50,000 tokens, revisit this approach.

## 2025-10-06: HTML-to-Plaintext Solutions for MCP Browser Token Optimization

**Problem:** MCP browser calls (`mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`) return full HTML snapshots consuming ~23k tokens per Medium article fetch. Need preprocessing to reduce token usage by 80-90%.

**Additional constraint:** Simple HTTP fetch libraries get blocked with 403 Forbidden by Medium's anti-bot protection. Solution must use real browser automation.

**Investigation scope:**
- Mozilla Readability algorithm
- html-to-text npm library
- Playwright text extraction (innerText/textContent)
- MCP servers (Fetch, Markdownify, community servers)
- Turndown HTML-to-markdown library
- Anti-bot bypass techniques

**Findings:**

### Solutions Investigated

| Solution | Bypasses 403? | Token Savings | Setup Effort | Content Quality |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Playwright + Readability.js | ✅ Yes | 85-90% | Medium | Excellent |
| Playwright + innerText | ✅ Yes | 70-80% | Low | Good |
| Playwright Stealth MCP | ✅ Yes | 85-90% | Medium | Excellent |
| Anthropic Fetch MCP | ❌ No | N/A | Low | N/A (blocked) |
| WebFetch tool | ❌ No | N/A | N/A | N/A (blocked) |
| Readability + Turndown | ❌ No | N/A | Medium | N/A (needs HTML first) |

### Solution Details

**1. Mozilla Readability (@mozilla/readability)**
- Battle-tested Firefox Reader View algorithm
- Extracts clean article content, removes navigation/ads/sidebars
- Returns structured data: `{ title, textContent, content, excerpt }`
- Works in Node.js with JSDOM or browser context
- CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mozilla/readability@latest/Readability.js`
- Optimized for article-style content
- Token savings: 85-90%

**2. Playwright Text Extraction**
- `innerText()` - Returns only visible text (excludes hidden elements)
- `textContent()` - Returns all text including hidden
- Built-in, zero dependencies
- Loses structure but simple and fast
- Token savings: 70-80% (includes UI text like buttons/menus)

**3. Playwright Stealth MCP (playwright-stealth-mcp)**
- Integrates puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
- Passes all public automation detection tests
- Custom user agent support
- Better anti-bot evasion than standard Playwright
- Token savings: 85-90% (when combined with content extraction)

**4. Anthropic Fetch MCP Server (mcp-server-fetch)**
- Official Anthropic solution
- Python-based (uvx/pip installation)
- Converts HTML to markdown
- Supports chunked reading with `start_index`
- **Limitation:** Uses HTTP requests, blocked by 403 on Medium
- Not viable for protected sites

**5. Turndown + Readability**
- Turndown converts HTML to Markdown
- Performance: 100 kB in 27ms, 1 MB in 280ms
- Gentle learning curve, well-maintained
- **Limitation:** Requires HTML first (can't bypass 403)
- Best used after Playwright fetch

### Anti-Bot Bypass Techniques

**What doesn't work:**
- Simple HTTP libraries (fetch, axios, curl) → 403 Forbidden
- Default user agents → Detected as bots

**What works:**
- Real browsers (Playwright, Puppeteer) → Full rendering
- Custom user agents → Mimics real browsers
- Stealth plugins → Removes automation fingerprints
- Headed mode → Better than headless for detection

**Playwright MCP configuration for bypass:**
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "playwright": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "@playwright/mcp@latest",
                "--user-agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Recommended Implementation

**Option A: Quick Fix (Current Playwright MCP)**
```javascript
// 1. Navigate (bypasses 403)
browser_navigate({ url: "https://medium.com/article" })

// 2. Extract with innerText
browser_evaluate({
    function: "() => document.querySelector('article, main').innerText"
})
```
- Pros: Works immediately, no setup
- Cons: 70-80% reduction (less optimal)

**Option B: Best Quality (Inject Readability)**
```javascript
// 1. Navigate
browser_navigate({ url: "https://medium.com/article" })

// 2. Inject Readability.js
browser_evaluate({
    function: `async () => {
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mozilla/readability@latest/Readability.js';
        await new Promise(r => { script.onload = r; document.head.appendChild(script); });
    }`
})

// 3. Extract clean content
browser_evaluate({
    function: `() => {
        const doc = document.cloneNode(true);
        const reader = new Readability(doc);
        const article = reader.parse();
        return article.textContent;  // Plain text (or article.content for HTML)
    }`
})
```
- Pros: 85-90% reduction, excellent quality
- Cons: Two-step evaluation process

**Option C: Install Stealth Version**
```bash
npm install -g playwright-stealth-mcp
```
- Best anti-bot evasion
- Same usage as Option B
- Recommended for heavily protected sites

### Performance Data

**Readability.js:**
- Extraction time: Negligible (client-side processing)
- Token reduction: ~23k tokens → ~2-3k tokens
- Quality: Excellent (removes 95% of boilerplate)

**Turndown (for reference):**
- 100 kB: 27ms
- 1 MB: 280ms
- 50 MB: 13.98s

**Playwright evaluation overhead:**
- Negligible when already in page context
- Script injection: ~100-200ms (one-time CDN fetch)

**Decision: RECOMMENDED - Option B (Playwright + Readability Injection)**

**Reasoning:**
- Solves both problems: 403 bypass + token reduction
- 85-90% token savings achieved
- Uses existing Playwright MCP (no new tools needed)
- Excellent content quality for articles/blog posts
- Minimal overhead (two evaluate calls)
- CDN-based, no local dependencies

**Alternative for simple use cases:** Option A (innerText) for quick extraction where perfect content quality isn't critical.

**Implementation note:** For production use, consider caching the Readability.js script to avoid CDN fetch on every page load.

**Future optimization:** Create custom MCP tool that wraps Playwright + Readability into single call.
