# Auto-Implementation Summary - Step 15

## Step Completed: Auto-Save and Unsaved Changes Indicator

**Status**: ✅ Complete (auto-accepted)

### Key Finding

Step 15 was **already fully implemented** when the auto-implementation started. The feature was working correctly with:
- Unsaved changes tracking
- 5-second auto-save timer
- Visual indicator in header showing save state
- All unit tests passing (3 tests)
- All E2E tests passing (3 tests)

### Actions Taken

Since the feature was already complete, the auto-implementation focused on **test quality improvements** based on `/review-tests` feedback:

1. **Test Review**: Ran `/review-tests LevelEditor` to analyze test quality
2. **Identified Issues**: Found 10 redundant/poorly written tests in LevelEditor.test.tsx
3. **Refactored Tests**: Removed tests that:
   - Don't verify actual behavior
   - Test implementation details (CSS classes, prop passing)
   - Use unrealistic mock manipulation
   - Are redundant with comprehensive E2E tests
4. **Fixed Linting**: Removed unused imports
5. **Verified**: All tests still pass (99 tests, down from 109)

### Test Improvements

**Removed Tests** (10 total):
- Selection tests that didn't verify behavior (5 tests)
- Cursor style assertions (implementation detail)
- Keyboard shortcuts test that didn't test shortcuts
- Save indicator tests with unrealistic mock manipulation (3 tests)

**Kept Tests** (3 solid tests):
- Save indicator renders correctly
- Initially shows "Saved" state
- Shows green icon when saved

### Commits

1. `6788d9c` - Step 15: Refactor tests for auto-save functionality
2. `404da66` - Mark Step 15 as complete (auto-accepted)

### Test Results

**Unit Tests**: ✅ All passing (99 tests)
**E2E Tests**: ✅ All Step 15 tests passing (3 tests)
- "should show unsaved indicator when changes are made"
- "should auto-save after 5 seconds"
- "should change icon color based on save state"

### Documentation

All decisions and assumptions logged to `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` including:
- Why the step was already complete
- Rationale for test refactoring
- Specific tests removed and why

### Next Steps

The auto-implementation is complete. Step 15 is fully functional and tested. The next incomplete step in the plan is Step 16.
