# CanvasBlox

**A fun, browser-based level editor for young game designers**

CanvasBlox helps kids design their game levels before implementing them in Roblox. It's a creative visual canvas tool where young designers can place tiles, objects, and spawn points, then export their designs.

Vibe coded with good engineering practices - we use tests, TypeScript, and clean architecture because even fun projects deserve quality code!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering

**Backend:**
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (schema ready, not yet connected)

**Testing:**
- Vitest (unit tests)
- Playwright (E2E tests)
- React Testing Library

## üß™ Testing

We follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

1. Write failing test first
2. Implement to make it pass
3. Run all tests: `npm test && npm run test:e2e`
4. Refactor if needed

Tests live **next to the code** they test:

```
client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.ts
client/src/hooks/useLevelEditor.test.ts  ‚Üê Test next to source
```

**Current Test Stats:**
- 189 unit tests
- 148 E2E tests
- Total: 337 tests passing

See [docs/TDD_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/TDD_PRINCIPLES.md) for TDD methodology.

---

## üé® Design Philosophy

**Minimalist and functional** - We focus on value over decoration:

- Dark theme optimized for long editing sessions
- Color-coded tools (blue for selection, green for drawing, purple for linking)
- Fast animations (200-400ms max)
- Pixel-perfect grid-based rendering
- Mario-inspired sky blue canvas background

See [docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for complete design system.

## ü§ù Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. Pick a task from [TASKS.md](TASKS.md)
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Run `npm test && npm run test:e2e`
5. Run `npm run lint:fix`
6. Commit with clear message

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed contribution guidelines.

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript** - Strict mode, avoid `any`
- **Testing** - 85%+ unit test coverage
- **Linting** - Biome (4-space indentation, IntelliJ style)
- **Formatting** - Auto-formatted on commit
